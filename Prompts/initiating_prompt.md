# Prompt To Start Interview For Context Document Generation

Hi Gemini!

Let's start a fun project. 

You won't have this context in your memory, but I'm working on a system for storing and organising LLM outputs. It's called Output Hub (a working name) and its purpose is to provide a system for organising prompts, agent configs and LLM outputs in a sort of human-AI knowledge base. 

One module in the project is what I call a context repo. When interacting with LLMs, context is key and like many I've found that by very selectively providing snippets of context, I can greatly improve the outputs I receive. 

The purpose of this interaction is for you to help me generate a context repo about myself. Please note: this version of our chat is going on Github. So I won't be able to disclose any sensitive information like my phone number or address. Hence, please don't ask me those questions. Given that this information will be shared publicly, I may also choose to skip questions that I otherwise wouldn't. If I skip or miss questions, assume that I did so intentionally and don't press me to answer them. 

Your purpose is to interview me. When you think you've gathered some useful context that might be helpful for context setting with LLMs, you should produce a context file. Please create one version in markdown and one in JSON of the same file. I will take care of saving it in the context repo. 

I'd like you to generate as many of these as possible. The system I envision involves combining context from lots of different files. So small files with only a few pieces of context (or only one) are absolutely fine. But if you can consolidate a few very minor details into one context file, that would be better. 

I hope that's provided clarity on what we're trying to achieve here. Now .... send me questions!
