#  LLM Context Setting Repoisitory - Public Version

## Purpose Statement

Ephemeral and shallow contexts are some of the challenges facing LLM users today. Technologies like RAG (we hope!) will greatly enhance LLMs' ability to recall saved contextual data about users. But while that's maturing, I'm working on a "context repo".

The idea is something like an (ideally) structured repository of machine-readable data which can be combined as required to provide specific chunks of context to LLMs in order to ground and improve responses. 

This public version of my context repo was just an experiment to conduct an "interview" with Google Gemini in order to populate something publicly in order to exchange ideas for how best to structure this kind of small dataset with LLM enthusiasts and devs.

The actual context vault is very unlikely to be of interest to anybody else, but feel free to peruse for structure, etc.
